All three available templates (40, 43, 39) are suitable for temperatures below 0°C, offering robust layering. I will aim to use a different template for each outfit if possible, prioritizing style matching. \\n2. **Outfit 1: Casual/streetwear/workwear**\\n    *   **Template Selection**: Template 40 ('4 Layer Style (<0°C)') is a good fit for this style, allowing for a cotton shirt, sweater/cardigan, and winter outerwear, which aligns well with casual/workwear aesthetics.\\n    *   **Anchor Selection (Shoes)**: I'll start with the 'tan hiking boots suede' (e6e61077-fad7-4c56-9ac4-61a9525e72c5) as they explicitly match the 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style and have a low wear count (2). The matching 'brown belt leather' (151a0e62-7ce3-4f7c-a0f1-78562e68e75a) will be used.\\n    *   **Layer Building**: \\n        *   **Bottoms**: 'medium blue slim fit jeans denim' (ed456323-0a5f-4d60-a1a3-0a60fe630c66) matches the style and casual boots. (wear_count: 2)\\n        *   **Base Layer**: 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) (wear_count: 4) is chosen as a standard undershirt. It's 'always' tucked, so the belt is mandatory.\\n        *   **Shirt Layer**: 'brown flannel shirt cotton long-sleeve' (0c39863c-46d9-4e0b-b09a-1baa7e406487) (wear_count: 0) provides warmth and a workwear aesthetic, and is 'always' tucked.\\n        *   **Mid Layer**: 'heather gray half-zip sweater lambs wool' (efba7f8d-38a6-4f96-bc7a-302f46109c67) (wear_count: 2) is warm, chunky, and fits the casual style well.\\n        *   **Outer Layer**: 'burnt orange puffer jacket synthetic' (3e2eb420-777e-4ec4-8d3c-32d57c0ade08) (wear_count: 3) offers excellent warmth and a vibrant casual accent.\\n    *   **Rule Verification**: All garments match the 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style. Belt matches shoes. Base and shirt layers are tucked, and a belt is present. Layer order is thin to thick. No double collar issues. All sleeve rules are met.\\n\\n3. **Outfit 2: Business casual**\\n    *   **Template Selection**: Initially considered Template 43 ('4 Layer Style (<0°C) - Turtle'), but all available turtlenecks only list 'Smart casual' in their styles[], not 'Business casual'. This violates the 'Style Matching' rule. Therefore, I will use Template 40 again, as it offers flexibility for Business Casual with a shirt and sweater/blazer combination.\\n    *   **Anchor Selection (Outerwear)**: I'll choose the 'navy blue pea coat lambs wool' (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd) (wear_count: 4) as it's warm and explicitly 'Business casual'. It was not used as the anchor in the first outfit.\\n    *   **Layer Building**: \\n        *   **Mid Layer**: 'charcoal gray v-neck sweater merino wool' (810241d5-a0eb-44ba-be7f-78858c8af945) (wear_count: 2) is a fine-knit merino sweater, perfect for layering under a pea coat and over a dress shirt for business casual. It explicitly matches the style.\\n        *   **Shirt Layer**: 'blue shirt dress shirt cotton long-sleeve' (f7f99a97-bd63-4c95-85a2-5724d1c27f3e) (wear_count: 0) is a classic business casual choice. It is 'always' tucked.\\n        *   **Base Layer**: 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) (wear_count: 4) as an undershirt, 'always' tucked.\\n        *   **Bottoms**: 'navy blue chinos cotton' (082a9ea6-e124-49c9-9a04-da38c20c31a7) (wear_count: 2) are a strong business casual staple. The tucked layers require a belt.\\n        *   **Shoes**: 'black hiking boots leather' (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) (wear_count: 4) are warm and versatile enough for business casual with chinos. \\n        *   **Belt**: 'black belt leather' (9bffbfb1-7f6a-4f16-9eed-57af5141a1e2) (wear_count: 4) matches the black boots.\\n    *   **Rule Verification**: All garments match the 'Business casual' style. Black belt matches black boots. Base and shirt layers are tucked, and a belt is present. Layer order is thin to thick. No double collar issues. All sleeve rules are met.\\n\\n4. **Outfit 3: Smart casual**\\n    *   **Template Selection**: Template 39 ('5 Layer Style (<0°C) - Sweater + Blazer') is chosen for a sophisticated Smart Casual look, offering maximum warmth and layering opportunities. This template has not been used yet.\\n    *   **Anchor Selection (Trousers)**: I'll select the 'charcoal gray chinos cotton' (9dd68be9-020b-48e3-9d51-5804ef2f53bc) (wear_count: 1) as they are versatile for smart casual and have a low wear count. They were not used as anchors in previous outfits. Tucked layers will require a belt.\\n    *   **Layer Building**: \\n        *   **Shoes**: 'black hiking boots leather' (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) (wear_count: 4) pair well with charcoal chinos and provide warmth for -9°C. \\n        *   **Belt**: 'black belt leather' (9bffbfb1-7f6a-4f16-9eed-57af5141a1e2) (wear_count: 4) matches the black boots.\\n        *   **Base Layer**: 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) (wear_count: 4) as an undershirt, 'always' tucked.\\n        *   **Shirt Layer**: 'white dress shirt cotton long-sleeve' (191f2c2b-8f04-4c47-aeb2-627aa48f1799) (wear_count: 1) is a clean, versatile option, 'always' tucked.\\n        *   **Mid Layer (Sweater)**: 'navy v-neck sweater merino wool' (dc49920d-aaac-45b9-8428-44aa933b2bb6) (wear_count: 0) provides warmth and a classic smart casual look over the shirt. It has a low wear count.\\n        *   **Mid Layer (Blazer)**: 'navy blue blazer jacket cotton' (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4) (wear_count: 4) is a core smart casual item and adds another layer of warmth and structure.\\n        *   **Outer Layer**: 'navy blue pea coat lambs wool' (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd) (wear_count: 4) provides excellent cold-weather protection and complements the smart casual aesthetic. It's acceptable to reuse this item.\\n    *   **Rule Verification**: All garments match the 'Smart casual' style. Black belt matches black boots. Base and shirt layers are tucked, and a belt is present. Layer order is thin to thick. No double collar issues.
