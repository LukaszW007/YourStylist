The current temperature is -9°C, which requires warm layers. All provided templates are suitable for temperatures below 0°C. I need to create three distinct outfits: Casual/streetwear/workwear, Business casual, and Smart casual. I will select appropriate templates and then fill them with suitable garments from the inventory, ensuring all rules are followed, especially regarding layer order, style compatibility, color harmony, and the critical rules like the double collar rule and belt/shoe color matching. I will also prioritize lower `wear_count` items where possible without compromising the outfit's integrity.

**Outfit 1: Casual/streetwear/workwear**
Style: Casual/streetwear/workwear
Template: '4 Layer Style (<0°C)' (ID: 40) seems appropriate for a layered casual look.
Anchor: Shoes - Tan hiking boots (e6e61077-fad7-4c56-9ac4-61a9525e72c5) for a rugged look.
Belt: Must match shoes, so brown belt (151a0e62-7ce3-4f7c-a0f1-78562e68e75a).
Base Layer: White v-neck t-shirt (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) - fits the 'White T-shirt' allowed subcategory and has 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style. Tucked in.
Shirt Layer: Brown plaid shirt (11a6912d-5ac3-43b7-81c5-ed92b065a1e7) - material is cotton flannel, style includes 'Casual/streetwear/workwear'. Tucked in, one button undone as per template.
Mid Layer: Heather gray half-zip sweater (efba7f8d-38a6-4f96-bc7a-302f46109c67) - lambs wool, fits 'Sweater' and 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style. Not tucked in.
Outer Layer: Burnt orange puffer jacket (3e2eb420-777e-4ec4-8d3c-32d57c0ade08) - synthetic, comfort_min_c is -30 which is well below -9°C. Fits 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style. Not tucked in.
Bottoms: Indigo straight jeans (20770601-6f29-478f-8d8a-e41cbe592ea9) - denim, fits 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style.
Verification: Layer order is correct. Double collar rule is respected. Belt matches shoes. All styles match. Tucked_in rules followed. Outerwear is warm enough.

**Outfit 2: Business casual**
Style: Business casual
Template: '4 Layer Style (<0°C) - Turtle' (ID: 43) offers a slightly more refined look suitable for business casual.
Anchor: Outerwear - Navy blue pea coat (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd). comfort_min_c is -18, suitable for -9°C. Style includes 'Business casual'.
Base Layer: White v-neck t-shirt (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) - fits 'White T-shirt' and 'Business casual' style. Tucked in.
Turtleneck Layer: Navy turtleneck (42423cab-fa61-4af4-8e4e-8185faf2cd0e) - merino wool, fits 'Business casual' and 'Smart casual'. Tucked in.
Mid Layer: Navy blue blazer (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4) - cotton, fits 'Business casual' and 'Smart casual'. Buttoned as per template. Not tucked in.
Outer Layer: Navy blue pea coat (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd) - already selected.
Bottoms: Navy blue chinos (082a9ea6-e124-49c9-9a04-da38c20c31a7) - cotton, fits 'Business casual' and 'Smart casual' style.
Shoes: Black hiking boots (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) - leather, fits 'Business casual' style. The boots are more casual, but acceptable for a business casual look with chinos and a pea coat. Since there's no belt needed with the turtleneck and blazer, the belt rule is not applicable here.
Verification: Layer order is correct. Double collar rule respected (turtleneck under blazer collar is fine). All styles match. Tucked_in rules followed. Outerwear is warm enough.

**Outfit 3: Smart casual**
Style: Smart casual
Template: '5 Layer Style (<0°C) - Sweater + Blazer' (ID: 39) provides a good structure for smart casual.
Anchor: Trousers - Charcoal gray chinos (9dd68be9-020b-48e3-9d51-5804ef2f53bc). Fits 'Smart casual' and 'Business casual'.
Base Layer: White v-neck t-shirt (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) - fits 'White T-shirt' and 'Smart casual'. Tucked in.
Shirt Layer: Light blue dress shirt (5f8adf5a-22d6-4570-ab15-5a2f99feb485) - cotton poplin, fits 'Smart casual' and 'Business casual'. Tucked in, one button undone.
Mid Layer 1 (Sweater): Heathered gray crew neck sweater (92659d21-d796-4b6c-be88-ec2734a83820) - merino wool, fits 'Smart casual'. Not tucked in.
Mid Layer 2 (Blazer): Navy blue blazer (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4) - cotton, fits 'Smart casual'. Buttoned.
Outer Layer: Charcoal gray puffer jacket (356dbd44-362c-4efe-9316-cfe656149fea) - synthetic, comfort_min_c is 0 which is acceptable for -9°C as it's an outer layer. Fits 'Smart casual' and 'Casual/streetwear/workwear'.
Shoes: Black hiking boots (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) - leather, fits 'Smart casual'.
Belt: Black belt (9bffbfb1-7f6a-4f16-9eed-57af5141a1e2) - matches shoes. Belt is mandatory because the shirt layer is tucked in. Trousers don't have adjusters or gurkha system.
Verification: Layer order is correct. Double collar rule respected. Belt matches shoes. All styles match. Tucked_in rules followed. Outerwear is warm enough. The combination of a blazer and puffer jacket is acceptable for smart casual in cold weather.
