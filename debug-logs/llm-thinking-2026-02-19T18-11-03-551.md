1. Weather: -9°C, Winter. All selected templates are for <0°C, ensuring warmth. I will prioritize items with lower wear_count where style and rules allow, but style compatibility and warmth are paramount for cold weather. 
2. Outfit Casual/streetwear/workwear: Starting from shoes. Selected tan hiking boots (e6e61077-fad7-4c56-9ac4-61a9525e72c5) as anchor for a rugged feel. Paired with a brown belt (151a0e62-7ce3-4f7c-a0f1-78562e68e75a) for color harmony. Used medium blue jeans (ed456323-0a5f-4d60-a1a3-0a60fe630c66) for a classic workwear base. Layered with a white v-neck t-shirt (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902), a warm brown flannel shirt (0c39863c-46d9-4e0b-b09a-1baa7e406487), a light gray lambswool cardigan (264e99d7-ad4a-4480-9d43-51a62cb78452), and a charcoal gray puffer jacket (356dbd44-362c-4efe-9316-cfe656149fea) for extreme cold. Template 40 chosen for its flexibility with casual mid-layers.
3. Outfit Business casual: Starting from outerwear. The navy blue pea coat (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd) is the most suitable for Business Casual in this cold. Initially considered Template 43 (Turtleneck), but no turtlenecks in inventory had 'Business casual' style. Switched to Template 39 (5 Layer Style - Sweater + Blazer) for formality and warmth. Paired with light blue chinos (98e7ea68-1d6e-4588-9d4d-80abd9af243d) for a lighter contrast. The black hiking boots (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) are the only business casual appropriate winter shoes, so a black belt (9bffbfb1-7f6a-4f16-9eed-57af5141a1e2) is chosen. Base is white t-shirt (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902), with a dusty rose oxford shirt (0397fcf8-5c69-4700-a85d-fe106c745af6) for a touch of color, a charcoal gray v-neck merino sweater (810241d5-a0eb-44ba-be7f-78858c8af945) for warmth, and the navy blue blazer (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4).
4. Outfit Smart casual: Starting from trousers. Selected sand chinos (c42bf44c-ed02-4f5f-bc5b-10744d6c90c2) for a classic smart casual look. Paired with black hiking boots (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) and a matching black belt (9bffbfb1-7f6a-4f16-9eed-57af5141a1e2). This outfit utilizes Template 43 (Turtleneck) to diversify template usage. Base is white t-shirt (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902), with a heathered gray turtleneck (a81413ff-0ea7-4d0b-837b-b4d1d08224ff) for warmth and style. The navy blue blazer (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4) and navy blue pea coat (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd) complete the sophisticated, warm layers. 
5. Verification: All outfits adhere to layer order, double collar rule (no polo/henley with shirt/turtleneck), JSON format, inventory only, belt logic (belt mandatory if tucked, color matches shoes), sleeve rule (long-sleeve for mid/shirt layers in 3+ layers), template compliance, name matching, style matching, color matching for white t-shirt, and subcategory exclusions. Hard rules from knowledge base were also checked. Garment reuse was necessary and explicitly allowed.
