I need to create three distinct outfits: Casual/streetwear/workwear, Business casual, and Smart casual, using only the provided inventory and adhering to all rules.\\n\\n**Outfit 1: Casual/streetwear/workwear**\\n- **Template Selection:** Template ID 40, '4 Layer Style (<0°C)', seems suitable for a casual winter outfit. It allows for a base layer, shirt, mid-layer, and outerwear.\\n- **Anchor Selection (Shoes):** Let's start with the 'tan hiking boots suede' (e6e61077-fad7-4c56-9ac4-61a9525e72c5) for a rugged, workwear feel.\\n- **Belt:** Since the shoes are brown, I need a brown belt. The 'brown belt leather' (151a0e62-7ce3-4f7c-a0f1-78562e68e75a) is available.\\n- **Bottoms:** Dark jeans are a good choice for casual/workwear. 'indigo straight jeans denim' (20770601-6f29-478f-8d8a-e41cbe592ea9) will work.\\n- **Base Layer:** Template requires 'White T-shirt' or 'Undershirt'. 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) is available and fits the style.\\n- **Shirt Layer:** Template requires 'Cotton Shirt'. 'blue denim button-down cotton shirt' (e1c0402b-7140-4eb3-a885-648512a5b5eb) fits the casual/workwear style and has a lower wear count.\\n- **Mid Layer:** Template allows 'Sweater', 'Cardigan', 'Shawl Cardigan', 'Blazer'. A chunky knit sweater suits the casual/workwear aesthetic. 'heather gray half-zip sweater lambs wool' (efba7f8d-38a6-4f96-bc7a-302f46109c67) has a lower wear count and is appropriate for the temperature.\\n- **Outer Layer:** Template allows 'Winter Outerwear', 'Parka', 'Overcoat', 'Pea Coat'. 'burnt orange puffer jacket synthetic' (3e2eb420-777e-4ec4-8d3c-32d57c0ade08) provides warmth and a pop of color for a casual look. It also matches the -7°C requirement.\\n- **Rule Check:** Layering order is correct (thin to thick). Double collar rule is respected. Belt matches shoes. All garments have 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' style. Tucked_in for base and shirt layers is 'always', and a belt is present. Sleeve rule for 4-layer outfits is fine as the shirt and base are long-sleeve/short-sleeve respectively. Mid-layer is a sweater, which is fine. Outerwear is a jacket.\\n\\n**Outfit 2: Business casual**\\n- **Template Selection:** Template ID 43, '4 Layer Style (<0°C) - Turtle', is good for Business Casual and introduces a different layering approach.\\n- **Anchor Selection (Outerwear):** Let's start with outerwear. 'navy blue pea coat lambs wool' (735b5639-e1da-4bb4-95b2-b47c273d58dd) is a classic business casual outerwear piece, suitable for -7°C.\\n- **Base Layer:** Template requires 'White T-shirt' or 'Undershirt'. 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) is available.\\n- **Turtleneck Layer:** Template requires 'Turtleneck'. 'navy turtleneck merino wool long-sleeve' (42423cab-fa61-4af4-8e4e-8185faf2cd0e) is available and has a lower wear count. It fits the business casual style and temperature.\\n- **Mid Layer:** Template requires 'Blazer'. 'navy blue blazer jacket cotton' (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4) is a good choice for business casual. It has a lower wear count.\\n- **Bottoms:** 'charcoal gray chinos cotton' (9dd68be9-020b-48e3-9d51-5804ef2f53bc) are versatile for business casual.\\n- **Shoes:** To match the navy pea coat and blazer, black shoes are appropriate. 'black hiking boots leather' (c140737a-362f-45bb-9072-7756d8dd7d75) are suitable for the temperature and style, though ideally, a dressier shoe would be better if available. Given the inventory, these are the most appropriate formal-leaning boots.\\n- **Belt:** Since the shoes are black, a black belt is required. 'black belt leather' (9bffbfb1-7f6a-4f16-9eed-57af5141a1e2) is available.\\n- **Rule Check:** Layering order is correct. Double collar rule is respected. Belt matches shoes. All garments have 'Business casual' or 'Smart casual' styles. Tucked_in for base and turtleneck are 'always', and a belt is present. Sleeve rule for 4-layer outfits is fine.\\n\\n**Outfit 3: Smart casual**\\n- **Template Selection:** Template ID 39, '5 Layer Style (<0°C) - Sweater + Blazer', offers more layering options for smart casual.\\n- **Anchor Selection (Trousers):** Let's start with trousers. 'sand chinos cotton' (c42bf44c-ed02-4f5f-bc5b-10744d6c90c2) are a classic smart casual choice.\\n- **Base Layer:** Template requires 'White T-shirt' or 'Undershirt'. 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) is available.\\n- **Shirt Layer:** Template requires 'Cotton Shirt'. 'light blue oxford shirt linen long-sleeve' (3a4bf58a-84bd-4fc8-8dbb-a49a79290a02) fits smart casual. However, linen is usually for warmer weather, but the prompt allows it and it has a lower wear count. For -7°C, a cotton shirt would be more appropriate. Let's switch to 'light blue dress shirt cotton long-sleeve' (808c98e0-1e4e-438b-ac88-df8ebd8945ca).\\n- **Mid Layer 1 (Sweater/Cardigan):** Template allows 'Sweater' or 'Cardigan'. 'heathered gray crew neck sweater merino wool' (92659d21-d796-4b6c-be88-ec2734a83820) is a good smart casual choice and has a lower wear count.\\n- **Mid Layer 2 (Blazer):** Template requires 'Blazer'. 'navy blue blazer jacket cotton' (deb0c3d6-355d-4212-9f08-8853aa3fe8e4) is already used in Outfit 2. I need to find an alternative. There are no other blazers. This template might be problematic. Let me re-evaluate templates. Template ID 40 '4 Layer Style (<0°C)' can also be used for smart casual. Let's use that for Outfit 3 instead of Template 39 to avoid the blazer issue.\\n\\n**Re-thinking Outfit 3: Smart casual**\\n- **Template Selection:** Template ID 40, '4 Layer Style (<0°C)', for Smart Casual.\\n- **Anchor Selection (Shoes):** Let's use 'tan hiking boots suede' (e6e61077-fad7-4c56-9ac4-61a9525e72c5) again, as it was not used in Outfit 2. This anchors the outfit.\\n- **Belt:** Brown belt to match brown shoes: 'brown belt leather' (151a0e62-7ce3-4f7c-a0f1-78562e68e75a).\\n- **Bottoms:** 'beige chinos cotton' (586345db-0310-44e2-b97f-1690c6ac81cb) are a smart casual staple.\\n- **Base Layer:** 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902).\\n- **Shirt Layer:** Template requires 'Cotton Shirt'. 'light blue dress shirt cotton long-sleeve' (808c98e0-1e4e-438b-ac88-df8ebd8945ca) is suitable.\\n- **Mid Layer:** Template allows 'Sweater', 'Cardigan', 'Shawl Cardigan', 'Blazer'. 'charcoal gray v-neck sweater merino wool' (810241d5-a0eb-44ba-be7f-78858c8af945) is a good smart casual option.\\n- **Outer Layer:** Template allows 'Winter Outerwear', 'Parka', 'Overcoat', 'Pea Coat'. 'charcoal gray puffer jacket synthetic' (356dbd44-362c-4efe-9316-cfe656149fea) provides warmth and matches the charcoal sweater and chinos.\\n- **Rule Check:** Layering order is correct. Double collar rule is respected. Belt matches shoes. All garments have 'Smart casual' or 'Casual/streetwear/workwear' styles. Tucked_in for base and shirt layers is 'always', and a belt is present. Sleeve rule for 4-layer outfits is fine.\\n\\n**Final check on garment reuse:**\\n- Base layer: 'white v-neck t-shirt cotton short-sleeve' (1ed3fb59-457f-4ed3-af6f-ef56969ab902) used in all three. This is acceptable as it's a foundational piece.\\n- Shoes: Tan boots in O1 & O3, Black boots in O2. OK.\\n- Belts: Brown belt in O1 & O3, Black belt in O2. OK.\\n- Bottoms: Jeans in O1, Charcoal chinos in O2, Beige chinos in O3. OK.\\n- Shirt Layer: Denim in O1, Navy Turtleneck (as replacement for shirt in Template 43) in O2, Light blue dress shirt in O3. OK.\\n- Mid Layer: Heather gray half-zip sweater in O1, Navy Blazer in O2, Charcoal v-neck sweater in O3. OK.\\n- Outer Layer: Burnt orange puffer in O1, Navy Pea Coat in O2, Charcoal puffer in O3. OK.\\n\\nAll styles are covered, temperature is handled, and rules seem to be met.\\n\",\n  \"outfits\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Casual/streetwear/workwear\",\n      \"template_used\": \"4 Layer Style (<0°C)\",\n      \"description\": \"A rugged and warm outfit for cold weather, combining durable textures for a workwear-inspired look.\",\n      \"reasoning\": \"This outfit uses hiking boots, denim, and a puffer jacket to create a casual and functional look suitable for -7°C.
