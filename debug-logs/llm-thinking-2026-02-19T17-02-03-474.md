1. Weather Analysis: The 'feels like' temperature of -9°C requires heavy layering. I have selected Template 40 (4-layer style) for all three outfits as it provides the most robust thermal protection and explicitly allows the available winter outerwear (Pea Coat and Puffer Jacket). 2. Outfit 1 (Casual/streetwear/workwear): Built around rugged workwear textures. I paired black leather hiking boots with medium-wash denim jeans. The upper body features a white t-shirt, a brown plaid flannel shirt for warmth, and a chunky charcoal lambswool half-zip sweater, all topped with a charcoal puffer jacket. 3. Outfit 2 (Business casual): Aimed for a professional winter look. I used the navy blue pea coat as the anchor. Underneath, a white dress shirt and navy blazer provide a classic business silhouette, paired with beige chinos for contrast. Black leather hiking boots are used for traction and warmth in sub-zero temperatures, matched with a black leather belt. 4. Outfit 3 (Smart casual): Focused on a refined yet relaxed palette. I combined indigo straight jeans with a light blue dress shirt and a fine charcoal merino wool v-neck sweater. The navy pea coat adds a structured outer layer. 5. Rule Verification: All outfits follow the thin-to-thick layering rule. Belts match the black shoes in every instance. All selected garments include the target style in their inventory metadata. No double collars are present. Short sleeves are restricted to the base layer only.
